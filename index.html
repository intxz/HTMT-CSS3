            <header>History of C</header>
            <p>The history of the C programming language dates back to the early 1970s when Dennis Ritchie and his colleagues at Bell Labs developed it as an evolution of the B programming language. With a focus on simplicity and efficiency, C quickly gained popularity and became the foundation for the development of the Unix operating system.</p>
            <p>Over the decades, C has proven its resilience and adaptability, remaining relevant in various computing domains. Its influence extends to the creation of C++, an object-oriented extension of the language, and it continues to inspire new generations of programmers. Explore the historical journey of C, from its inception to its enduring impact on the world of programming.</p>

    <header>Declaring Variables</header>
    <p>Before you can use variables in C, you must declare them. Variable declaration involves specifying the data type and the name of the variable. This section provides a comprehensive guide to declaring variables, a fundamental step in writing C programs.</p>
    <p>Explore the syntax for declaring variables of different data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, characters, and more. Understand the importance of declaring variables before using them and learn how to initialize variables during declaration.</p>
    <code>// Declare an integer variable
int age;

// Declare a floating-point variable
float price;

// Declare a character variable
char grade;

// Declare multiple variables of the same type
int num1, num2, sum;

// Declare and initialize a variable
double pi = 3.14159;</code>
    <code>// More examples of variable declarations
unsigned int quantity;

short int temperature;

long double distance;

char symbol;

float acceleration;</code>
    <code>// Declare variables and assign values
int x, y, z;

x = 10;

y = 20;

z = x + y;</code>
    <code>// Declare and initialize constants
const int MAX_SIZE = 100;

const double PI = 3.14159265359;</code>
